## Tree 
### Binary Trees (Day 1)
- Tree Class Defination 
- DFS
    - Recurrsion -> Done
        - Inorder Traversal
        - Preorder Traversal
        - Postorder Traversal
    - Iterative
        - Inorder Traversal -> Done
        - Preorder Traversal -> Done
        - Postorder Traversal **
- BFS -> Done
    - Level Order Traversal
    - Print I'th level of the tree
    - Print Number of nodes in each levels
    - Zigzag Level Order Traversal

### Binary Trees (Day 2)
- Basic Tree Struction Quesions
    - No. of Nodes
    - No. of leaf node
    - Max Hight of the tree
    - Min Hight of the tree
    - Width of the tree
    - Node Value Sum
- Tree View
    - Recurrsive
        - Left View
        - Right View
        - Top View
        - Bottom View
    - Iterative 
        - Left View
        - Right View
        - Top View
        - Bottom View

### Binary Trees (Day 3)

- Balanced Binary Tree
- Construct Binary Tree
    - From Lavel Order Traversal
    - From Preorder and Inorder Traversal
    - From Inorder and Postorder Traversal
